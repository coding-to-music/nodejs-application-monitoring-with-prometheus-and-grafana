# The RED Method: How to Instrument Your Services

![Tom Wilkie - Grafana Labs](https://github.com/coding-to-music/nodejs-application-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana/blob/main/images/tom_wilkie.jpg?raw=true)

Tom Wilkie - Grafana Labs

At GrafanaCon EU in March, we had the pleasure of introducing one of Grafana Labs‚Äô newest team members, Tom Wilkie, who joined as VP, Product with the acquisition of Kausal.

And he came bearing gifts: his popular talk about the RED Method of monitoring microservices, which he created in 2015.

## The USE Method

In the talk, Tom first went over the USE Method of instrumenting, which has been popularized by Brendan Gregg:

For every resource, monitor:

- Utilization (% time that the resource was busy)
- Saturation (amount of work resource has to do, often queue length)
- Errors (count of error events)

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a way of building a checklist that goes through everything,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt helps you know what you don‚Äôt know.‚Äù But he pointed out that this method, while useful, is somewhat abstract. Applying it to memory, for instance, is hard. ‚ÄúMemory utilization is tricky. What is it? Do you count caches toward utilization?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSaturation of memory is kind of a weird one‚Ä¶ And what is a memory error? And how do you count them in Linux?‚Äù

## The RED Method

Tom then turned to his RED Method, which he created after a new employee asked what his monitoring philosophy was. ‚ÄúThe USE Method doesn‚Äôt really apply to services; it applies to hardware, network disks, things like this,‚Äù Tom said. ‚ÄúWe really wanted a microservices-oriented monitoring philosophy, so we came up with the RED Method.‚Äù

For every resource, monitor:

- Rate (the number of requests per second)
- Errors (the number of those requests that are failing)
- Duration (the amount of time those requests take)

- (See his presentation slides on the Prometheus implementation of the RED Method) https://grafana.com/files/grafanacon_eu_2018/Tom_Wilkie_GrafanaCon_EU_2018.pdf

‚ÄúEveryone should understand the error rate, the request rate, and then some distribution of latency for those requests,‚Äù Tom explained.

‚ÄúYou model this for every single service in your architecture, and this gives you a nice, consistent view of how your architecture is behaving. Giving this kind of consistency across services allows you to scale your operational team, and allows you to put people on call for code they didn‚Äôt write.‚Äù

Plus, he pointed out, ‚ÄúThe RED Method is a good proxy to how happy your customers will be. If you‚Äôve got a high error rate, that‚Äôs basically going through to your users and they‚Äôre getting page load errors. If you‚Äôve got a high duration, your website is slow. So these are really good metrics for building meaningful alerts and measuring your SLA.‚Äù

## The Four Golden Signals

Finally, Tom looked at a third method: The Four Golden Signals, which is from Google‚Äôs SRE book. https://landing.google.com/sre/book.html

For each service, monitor:

- Latency (time taken to serve a request)
- Traffic (how much demand is placed on your system)
- Errors (rate of requests that are failing)
- Saturation (how ‚Äúfull‚Äù your service is)

This is basically the same as the RED Method, but includes saturation. He explained one approach to measuring saturation: ‚ÄúWith kube-state-metrics, a little job you run on your Kubernetes cluster that scrapes the Kubernetes API and exports really interesting metadata about your jobs and services and pods and so on, you can compare the amount of CPU a service is using against its quota. Like how much it should be using, or how much is it allowed to use, as a proportion between 1 and 0. This gives you a measure of how ‚Äòfull‚Äô your service is, or some proxy for how full your service is at least. And this is super useful because you could for instance build an alert on this.‚Äù

## Two Sides of the Same Coin

Tom recommended using the USE and RED Methods together. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like the RED Method is about caring about your users and how happy they are,‚Äù Tom said, ‚Äúand the USE Method is about caring about your machines and how happy they are. It‚Äôs really just two different views on the same system. They‚Äôre complimentary.‚Äù

We discuss this repository in this article in detail:
https://codersociety.com/blog/articles/nodejs-application-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana

The repository contains a sample Node.js app which integrates the [Prometheus client for node.js](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client) and exposes metrics on [http://localhost:8080/metrics](http://localhost:8080/metrics). The metrics are periodically scraped by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and visualized through a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana) monitoring dashboard.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)

## Getting started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coder-society/nodejs-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd nodejs-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana
```

Start the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Test containers

- Prometheus should be accessible via [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
- Grafana should be accessible via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Example Node.js server metrics for RED monitoring should be accessible via [http://localhost:8080/metrics](http://localhost:8080/metrics)

## Open monitoring dashboards

Open in your web browser the monitoring dashboards:

- Monitoring dashboard for the Node.js app can be found on[http://localhost:3000/d/1DYaynomMk/example-service-dashboard](http://localhost:3000/d/1DYaynomMk/example-service-dashboard)

## What is Prometheus and how does it work?

![](https://github.com/coding-to-music/nodejs-application-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana/blob/main/images/Performance-Monitoring-Table.png?raw=true)

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system which was created in 2012 by Soundcloud. In 2016, Prometheus became the second project (following Kubernetes) to be hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

## Performance Monitoring architecture diagram with Prometheus and Grafana

The Prometheus server collects metrics from your servers and other monitoring targets by pulling their metric endpoints over HTTP at a predefined time interval. For ephemeral and batch jobs, for which metrics can't be scraped periodically due to their short-lived nature, Prometheus offers a Pushgateway. This is an intermediate server that monitoring targets can push their metrics to before exiting. The data is retained there until the Prometheus server pulls it later.

The core data structure of Prometheus is the time series, which is essentially a list of timestamped values that are grouped by metric.

With PromQL (Prometheus Query Language), Prometheus provides a functional query language allowing for selection and aggregation of time series data in real time. The result of a query can be viewed directly in the Prometheus web UI, or consumed by external systems such as Grafana via the HTTP API.

## How to use prom-client to export metrics in Node.js for Prometheus?

prom-client is the most popular Prometheus client libary for Node.js. It provides the building blocks to export metrics to Prometheus via the pull and push methods and supports all Prometheus metric types such as histogram, summaries, gauges and counters.

## Setup sample Node.js project

Create a new directory and setup the Node.js project:

```
mkdir example-nodejs-app
cd example-nodejs-app
npm init -y
```

## Install prom-client

The prom-client npm module can be installed via:

```
npm install prom-client
```

## Exposing default metrics

Every Prometheus client library comes with predefined default metrics that are assumed to be good for all applications on the specific runtime. The prom-client library also follows this convention. The default metrics are useful for monitoring the usage of resources such as memory and CPU.

You can capture and expose the default metrics with following code snippet:

```
const http = require('http')
const url = require('url')
const client = require('prom-client')

// Create a Registry which registers the metrics
const register = new client.Registry()

// Add a default label which is added to all metrics
register.setDefaultLabels({
  app: 'example-nodejs-app'
})

// Enable the collection of default metrics
client.collectDefaultMetrics({ register })

// Define the HTTP server
const server = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  // Retrieve route from request object
  const route = url.parse(req.url).pathname

  if (route === '/metrics') {
    // Return all metrics the Prometheus exposition format
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', register.contentType)
    res.end(register.metrics())
  }
})

// Start the HTTP server which exposes the metrics on http://localhost:8080/metrics
server.listen(8080)
Collapse code
Exposing custom metrics
While default metrics are a good starting point, at some point, you‚Äôll need to define custom metrics in order to stay on top of things.

Capturing and exposing a custom metric for HTTP request durations might look like this:

const http = require('http')
const url = require('url')
const client = require('prom-client')

// Create a Registry which registers the metrics
const register = new client.Registry()

// Add a default label which is added to all metrics
register.setDefaultLabels({
  app: 'example-nodejs-app'
})

// Enable the collection of default metrics
client.collectDefaultMetrics({ register })

// Create a histogram metric
const httpRequestDurationMicroseconds = new client.Histogram({
  name: 'http_request_duration_seconds',
  help: 'Duration of HTTP requests in microseconds',
  labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'code'],
  buckets: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10]
})

// Register the histogram
register.registerMetric(httpRequestDurationMicroseconds)

// Define the HTTP server
const server = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
    // Start the timer
  const end = httpRequestDurationMicroseconds.startTimer()

  // Retrieve route from request object
  const route = url.parse(req.url).pathname

  if (route === '/metrics') {
    // Return all metrics the Prometheus exposition format
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', register.contentType)
    res.end(register.metrics())
  }

  // End timer and add labels
  end({ route, code: res.statusCode, method: req.method })
})

// Start the HTTP server which exposes the metrics on http://localhost:8080/metrics
server.listen(8080)
```

Copy the above code into a file called server.js and start the Node.js HTTP server with following command:

```
node server.js
```

You should now be able to access the metrics via http://localhost:8080/metrics.

How to scrape metrics from Prometheus
Prometheus is available as Docker image and can be configured via a YAML file.

Create a configuration file called prometheus.yml with following content:

```
global:
  scrape_interval: 5s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "example-nodejs-app"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["docker.for.mac.host.internal:8080"]
```

The config file tells Prometheus to scrape all targets every 5 seconds. The targets are defined under scrape_configs. On Mac, you need to use docker.for.mac.host.internal as host, so that the Prometheus Docker container can scrape the metrics of the local Node.js HTTP server. On Windows, use docker.for.win.localhost and for Linux use localhost.

Use the docker run command to start the Prometheus Docker container and mount the configuration file (prometheus.yml):

```
docker run --rm -p 9090:9090 \
  -v `pwd`/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  prom/prometheus:v2.20.1
```

Windows users need to replace pwd with the path to their current working directory.

You should now be able to access the Prometheus Web UI on http://localhost:9090

## What is Grafana and how does it work?

Grafana is a web application that allows you to visualize data sources. A visualization can be a graph or chart. It comes with a variety of chart types, allowing you to choose whatever fits your monitoring data needs. Multiple charts are grouped into dashboards in Grafana, so that multiple metrics can be viewed at once.

The metrics displayed in the Grafana charts come from data sources. Prometheus is one of the supported data sources for Grafana, but it can also use other systems, like AWS CloudWatch, or Azure Monitor.

Grafana also allows you to define alerts that will be triggered if certain issues arise, meaning you‚Äôll receive an email notification if something goes wrong. For a more advanced alerting setup checkout the Grafana integration for Opsgenie.

![](https://github.com/coding-to-music/nodejs-application-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana/blob/main/images/Grafana.png?raw=true)

## Starting Grafana

Grafana is also available as Docker container. Grafana datasources can be configured via a configuration file.

## Create a configuration file called datasources.yml with following content:

```
apiVersion: 1

datasources:
  - name: Prometheus
    type: prometheus
    access: proxy
    orgId: 1
    url: http://docker.for.mac.host.internal:9090
    basicAuth: false
    isDefault: true
    editable: true
```

The configuration file specifies Prometheus as a datasource for Grafana. Please note that on Mac, we need to use docker.for.mac.host.internal as host, so that Grafana can access Prometheus. On Windows, use docker.for.win.localhost and for Linux use localhost.

Use the following command to start a Grafana Docker container and to mount the configuration file of the datasources (datasources.yml). We also pass some environment variables to disable the login form and to allow anonymous access to Grafana:

```
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  -e GF_AUTH_DISABLE_LOGIN_FORM=true \
  -e GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=true \
  -e GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE=Admin \
  -v `pwd`/datasources.yml:/etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources/datasources.yml \
  grafana/grafana:7.1.5
```

Windows users need to replace pwd with the path to their current working directory.

You should now be able to access the Grafana Web UI on http://localhost:3000

## Configuring a Grafana Dashboard

Once the metrics are available in Prometheus, we want to view them in Grafana. This requires creating a dashboard and adding panels to that dashboard:

- Go to the Grafana UI at http://localhost:3000, click the + button on the left, and select Dashboard.
- In the new dashboard, click on the Add new panel button.
- In the Edit panel view, you can select a metric and configure a chart for it.
- The Metrics drop-down on the bottom left allows you to choose from the available metrics. Let‚Äôs use one of the default metrics for this example.
- Type process_resident_memory_bytes into the Metrics input and {{app}} into the Legend input.
- On the right panel, enter Memory Usage for the Panel title.
- As the unit of the metric is in bytes we need to select bytes(Metric) for the left y axis in the Axes section, so that the chart is easy to read for humans.
- You should now see a chart showing the memory usage of the Node.js HTTP server.

![](https://github.com/coding-to-music/nodejs-application-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana/blob/main/images/grafana-dashboard.png?raw=true)

Grafana Web UI showing editing of panel Metrics

Press Apply to save the panel. Back on the dashboard, click the small "save" symbol at the top right, a pop-up will appear allowing you to save your newly created dashboard for later use.

## Setting up alerts in Grafana

Since nobody wants to sit in front of Grafana all day watching and waiting to see if things go wrong, Grafana allows you to define alerts. These alerts regularly check whether a metric adheres to a specific rule, for example, whether the errors per second have exceeded a specific value.

Alerts can be set up for every panel in your dashboards.

Go into the Grafana dasboard we just created.

- Click on a panel title and select edit.
- Once in the edit view, select "Alerts" from the middle tabs, and press the Create Alert button.
- In the Conditions section specify 42000000 after IS ABOVE. This tells Grafana to trigger an alert when - the Node.js HTTP server consumes more than 42 MB Memory.
- Save the alert by pressing the Apply button in the top right.

![](https://github.com/coding-to-music/nodejs-application-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana/blob/main/images/grafana-alerting-setup.png?raw=true)

## Sample code repository

We created a code repository which contains a collection of Docker containers with Prometheus, Grafana, and a Node.js sample application. It also contains a Grafana dashboard, which follows the RED monitoring methodology.

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/coder-society/nodejs-application-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana.git
```

The JavaScript code of the Node.js app is located in the /example-nodejs-app directory. All containers can be started conveniently with docker-compose. Run the following command in the project root directory:

```
# detached mode
docker-compose up -d
# view the logs as they happen
docker-compose up
```

After executing the command, a Node.js app, Grafana, and Prometheus will be running in the background. The charts of the gathered metrics can be accessed and viewed via the Grafana UI at http://localhost:3000/d/1DYaynomMk/example-service-dashboard.

![](https://github.com/coding-to-music/nodejs-application-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana/blob/main/images/grafana-example-service-dashboard.png?raw=true)

To generate traffic for the Node.js app, we will use the ApacheBench command line tool, which allows sending requests from the command line.

On MacOS, it comes pre-installed by default. On Debian-based Linux distributions, ApacheBench can be installed with the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils
```

For Windows, you can download the binaries from Apache Lounge as a ZIP archive. ApacheBench will be named ab.exe in that archive.

This CLI command will run ApacheBench so that it sends 10,000 requests to the /order endpoint of the Node.js app:

https://codersociety.com/blog/articles/nodejs-application-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana

```
ab -m POST -n 10000 -c 100 http://localhost:8080/order
```

Output:

For the 10,000 requests we sent with ApacheBench, this means the 1,000 requests that took the longest time. In this case, it shows that 1,000 requests to the /order endpoint took over 6 seconds.

## Summary

Prometheus is a powerful open-source tool for self-hosted monitoring. It‚Äôs a good option for cases in which you don‚Äôt want to build from scratch but also don‚Äôt want to invest in a SaaS solution.

With a community-supported client library for Node.js and numerous client libraries for other languages, the monitoring of all your systems can be bundled into one place.

Its integration is straightforward, involving just a few lines of code. It can be done directly for long-running services or with help of a push server for short-lived jobs and FaaS-based implementations.

Grafana is also an open-source tool that integrates well with Prometheus. Among the many benefits it offers are flexible configuration, dashboards that allow you to visualize any relevant metric, and alerts to notify of any anomalous behavior.

These two tools combined offer a straightforward way to get insights into your systems. Prometheus offers huge flexibility in terms of metrics gathered and Grafana offers many different graphs to display these metrics. Prometheus and Grafana also integrate so well with each other that it‚Äôs surprising they‚Äôre not part of one product.

You should now have a good understanding of Prometheus and Grafana and how to make use of them to monitor your Node.js projects in order to gain more insights and confidence of your software deployments.
