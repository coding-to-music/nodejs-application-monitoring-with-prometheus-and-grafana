We discuss this repository in this article in detail:
https://codersociety.com/blog/articles/nodejs-application-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana

The repository contains a sample Node.js app which integrates the [Prometheus client for node.js](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client) and exposes metrics on [http://localhost:8080/metrics](http://localhost:8080/metrics). The metrics are periodically scraped by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and visualized through a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana) monitoring dashboard.

# Node.js Application Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

![](https://cdn.codersociety.com/uploads/keystone/nodejs-performance-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana.png)

We discuss this repository in this article in detail:
https://codersociety.com/blog/articles/nodejs-application-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana

The repository contains a sample Node.js app which integrates the [Prometheus client for node.js](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client) and exposes metrics on [http://localhost:8080/metrics](http://localhost:8080/metrics). The metrics are periodically scraped by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and visualized through a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana) monitoring dashboard.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)

## Getting started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coder-society/nodejs-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd nodejs-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana
```

Start the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Test containers

- Prometheus should be accessible via [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
- Grafana should be accessible via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Example Node.js server metrics for RED monitoring should be accessible via [http://localhost:8080/metrics](http://localhost:8080/metrics)

## Open monitoring dashboards

Open in your web browser the monitoring dashboards:

- Monitoring dashboard for the Node.js app can be found on[http://localhost:3000/d/1DYaynomMk/example-service-dashboard](http://localhost:3000/d/1DYaynomMk/example-service-dashboard)

## Sample code repository

We created a code repository which contains a collection of Docker containers with Prometheus, Grafana, and a Node.js sample application. It also contains a Grafana dashboard, which follows the RED monitoring methodology.

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/coder-society/nodejs-application-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana.git
```

The JavaScript code of the Node.js app is located in the /example-nodejs-app directory. All containers can be started conveniently with docker-compose. Run the following command in the project root directory:

```
# detached mode
docker-compose up -d
# view the logs as they happen
docker-compose up
```

After executing the command, a Node.js app, Grafana, and Prometheus will be running in the background. The charts of the gathered metrics can be accessed and viewed via the Grafana UI at http://localhost:3000/d/1DYaynomMk/example-service-dashboard.

To generate traffic for the Node.js app, we will use the ApacheBench command line tool, which allows sending requests from the command line.

On MacOS, it comes pre-installed by default. On Debian-based Linux distributions, ApacheBench can be installed with the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils
```

For Windows, you can download the binaries from Apache Lounge as a ZIP archive. ApacheBench will be named ab.exe in that archive.

This CLI command will run ApacheBench so that it sends 10,000 requests to the /order endpoint of the Node.js app:

https://codersociety.com/blog/articles/nodejs-application-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana

```
ab -m POST -n 10000 -c 100 http://localhost:8080/order
```

Output:

```
