We discuss this repository in this article in detail:
https://codersociety.com/blog/articles/nodejs-application-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana

The repository contains a sample Node.js app which integrates the [Prometheus client for node.js](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client) and exposes metrics on [http://localhost:8080/metrics](http://localhost:8080/metrics). The metrics are periodically scraped by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and visualized through a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana) monitoring dashboard.

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)

## Getting started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coder-society/nodejs-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd nodejs-monitoring-with-prometheus-and-grafana
```

Start the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Test containers

- Prometheus should be accessible via [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
- Grafana should be accessible via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Example Node.js server metrics for RED monitoring should be accessible via [http://localhost:8080/metrics](http://localhost:8080/metrics)

## Open monitoring dashboards

Open in your web browser the monitoring dashboards:

- Monitoring dashboard for the Node.js app can be found on[http://localhost:3000/d/1DYaynomMk/example-service-dashboard](http://localhost:3000/d/1DYaynomMk/example-service-dashboard)
